- [Sunil Pai's Thoughts](https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/sunil/)
> `code-mod` with "dynamic worker loaders" could mean "better" MCP Servers. Potentially, this will reduce complexity when managing security for MCP servers. Also, I'm a fan of the reduced token carry over in the models' reasoning chain. In essence, these two will allow "unique" case code generation (throw away code) that will be run inside a sandbox which later communicates back to the MCP server via postMessage with results.
