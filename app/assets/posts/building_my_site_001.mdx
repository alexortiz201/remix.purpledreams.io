# Building my site 001

> A small set of posts to document my process building out my portfolio site, which I also use to manage my clients' sites and my blog.

#### Why write about this?
I've been having to update my schema as I build new functionality out for my site. Every time I update the schema I have to update the prisma client and the db to reflect the changes. Unfortunately, since I'm working on both the site to support posts and a blog while also developing out the Rust & Wasm game, these changes happen scarcely and I am lost all over again when updating the blog. Time to fix this by writing all this down.


##### Custom Paths in package.json borked
Turns out once you add something like a root pointer `"#*: './*'"` this exact line needs to go into the typescript compiler, ðŸ™ˆ *DUH!* Now configs are easily imported.

##### Updating my schema and seed file
So the first thing I wanted to extend the seed file with were two seed posts for my blog. Initially, I did this when modifying my roles to support multi

##### What's next? DB

##### Quick pivot... [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/)
I was going to work on developing the DB to support MDX content but I realized Keystatic would cut the active blog dev time down to a fraction and allows some github mode integration niceness. Also its FREEEEE!

##### Package.json changes
I'm gonna list updates to my package.json here with notes on why I added this stuff

First,

```json
// # package.json
...
"import": {
	"#*": "./*", // Added easy root import paths as '#/keystatic.config'
}
...
```

Second,
```json
// # tsconfig.json
...
"compilerOptions": {

	"moduleResolution": "bundler", // Makes it so typescript doesn't squiggly on node_module imports, not sure why some wouldn't error and others would, but this fixed it.
...
"paths": {
	"#*": ["./*"], // Same reason as package.json above
...
```
