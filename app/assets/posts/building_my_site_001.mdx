> A small set of posts to document my process building out my portfolio site, which I also use to manage my clients' sites and my blog.

#### Why write about this?
I've been having to update my schema as I build new functionality out for my site. Every time I update the schema I have to update the prisma client and the db to reflect the changes. Unfortunately, since I'm working on both the site to support posts and a blog while also developing out the Rust & Wasm game, these changes happen scarcely and I am lost all over again when updating the blog. Time to fix this by writing all this down.


#### Custom Paths in package.json borked
Turns out once you add something like a root pointer `"#*: './*'"` this exact line needs to go into the typescript compiler, ðŸ™ˆ *DUH!* Now configs are easily imported.

#### Updating my schema and seed file
So the first thing I wanted to extend the seed file with were two seed posts for my blog. Initially, I did this when modifying my roles to support multi

#### What's next? DB

#### Quick pivot... [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/)
I was going to work on developing the DB to support MDX content but I realized Keystatic would cut the active blog dev time down to a fraction and allows some github mode integration niceness. Also its FREEEEE!

#### Package.json changes
I'm gonna list updates to my package.json here with notes on why I added this stuff

First,

```json
// # package.json
...
"import": {
	"#*": "./*", // Added easy root import paths as '#/keystatic.config'
}
...
```

Second,
```json
// # tsconfig.json
...
"compilerOptions": {

	"moduleResolution": "bundler", // Makes it so typescript doesn't squiggly on node_module imports, not sure why some wouldn't error and others would, but this fixed it.
...
"paths": {
	"#*": ["./*"], // Same reason as package.json above
...
```

#### Fly.io is deploying now...
Using `fly logs` I was able to determine that my esbuild in my mdx package isn't getting found. I had to delete the package-lock.json and re-install. I also deleted all the node_modules before installing. This caused an issue with prisma and its dependancy in the node_modules to go missing,
`import { searchUsers } from '@prisma/client/sql'`
in my `users+/index.html` file. That did it!


#### Typescript screaming over typographyplugin
Had to add `"esModuleInterop": true,` to my tsconfig.json so tailwind.config.ts would allow me to import the plugin `import typographyPlugin from '@tailwindcss/typography'`


#### Moving my site from github pages to fly.io
I took a few steps just cause I'm not the most familiar with all this. First thing I noticed was the even though I was point at my fly.io project with an A record on my apex domain (and AAAA record), after a few hours it was still resolving to vercel's ip. I'm not sure if it was cache but the day before I saw my purpledreams.io resolve after being down when pointing away from github pages with the new records. Well, the next day it was down again. I wasn't sure but github pages tells you to put a CNAME record on the project to point to the domain, I'm not sure if github does something with this, as in pushing this to DNS servers and what not. To make sure github's cname file wasn't causing issues I deleted that. Afterwards, the domain routing was not working yet and it still pointed to vercel's ips. My last step after a lot of looking around was to create the certs through fly.io `fly certs add purpledreams.io` and `fly certs add www.purpledreams.io`. Then, adding a cname record to my domain in the vercel app as suggested by the feedback in the fly.io cli tool. BANG! It's live now!
I'm not sure if maybe fly.io requires certs in its platform, if certs can't be transferred when changing records or ips, if the cname record was missing, or if having a CNAME file in github pages does something to fudge the DNS server's cache of said CNAME. I'll have to test this out individually to see.
